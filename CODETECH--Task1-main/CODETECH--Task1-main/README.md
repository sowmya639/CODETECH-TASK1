OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

PROJECT: LINNEAR REGRESSION ON HOUSING PRICES

OBJECTIVE
The objective of using linear regression on house prices is to build a predictive model that estimates the price of a house based on various features. These features might include square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, age of the property, and other factors that typically influence housing prices.

KEY ACTIVITES
Predict House Prices: The primary objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict the selling price of a house based on the provided features.

Identify Key Predictors: Through linear regression, you can determine which features are the most significant predictors of house prices. This can help homeowners, real estate agents, and developers understand the driving factors behind property valuation.

Simple, Interpretable Model: Linear regression provides a relatively simple and interpretable model, where you can see the relationship between each predictor and the target variable (house price). The coefficients of the regression model indicate how much the house price is expected to change with a unit change in the predictor variable.

Detect Trends: Linear regression helps detect patterns and trends in housing prices, which can be valuable for real estate investors and policymakers to understand the housing market dynamics.


TECHNOLOGIES USED
Python: The most popular language for data science and machine learning, with a rich ecosystem of libraries for linear regression and related tasks.
Scikit-learn: A robust machine learning library that includes tools for regression, classification, and clustering, making it easy to implement linear regression models.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preparation, often used for organizing housing datasets.
NumPy: For numerical operations, matrix operations, and efficient data handling.
Matplotlib / Seaborn: Visualization libraries for plotting the regression results, relationships between variables, etc.
